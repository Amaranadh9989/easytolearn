<p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;The&nbsp;actions&nbsp;required</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These must be identified fully and precisely, otherwise the results expected will not be achieved. The expected effects of these actions must also be identified, so that you will know when they have been carried out successfully. This part of the plan can be constructed as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>state your objective</li><li>list the individual goals in the order in which they must be achieved to reach that objective</li><li>identify what actions are required to achieve each goal, determine the sequence in which they need to be carried out, and record them</li><li>define, in measurable terms, what a successful outcome will be for each action and add the details to the plan.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sequence you choose for the various actions and goals is determined by a number of factors. In some situations it may be necessary to complete one action or set of actions before another can begin, eg laying a foundation before building a wall. Actions also have to run consecutively when they each use the same resource to its available capacity. On other occasions actions can run concurrently, such as when each member of a team is assigned a specific piece of equipment to test and evaluate.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all but the very simplest plans it's wise to&nbsp;<em>use a diagram, to represent the sequence of actions&nbsp;</em>and how they contribute to the overall objective. This helps to show how the actions interact and to reveal areas of possible conflict. Actions should be fitted together as closely as possible, to prevent wastage of resources, while allowing some margin for overrun. To do this you need to prepare a time schedule for the actions.</p>

<p><strong><em>2.</em>&nbsp;<em>Scheduling the&nbsp;</em>actions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create&nbsp;<em>a time schedule&nbsp;</em>for the actions, first you identify the time required to complete each action. By representing this information on the diagram you can calculate at what stage, relative to the starting time, each action will commence and finish, and determine the total time required to achieve the objective. Simple plans can be represented by a chart which uses bars to show the sequence and duration of the actions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More complex plans require a more flexible structure<em>,&nbsp;</em>like a chain diagram or flow chart. Diagrams help you to arrange the actions in a way which makes the best use of time and other resources. In drawing up a schedule. it's important not to be over-optimistic in the time you allow for each action. Additional time is required to accommodate delays and unforeseen obstacles, particularly with actions which must be completed on time or which are susceptible to delays.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>3. The resources required</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For each action the resources required have to be precisely defined along a number of parameters, including the type, amount and when they are required. Each resource is considered individually:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time</strong>&nbsp;is sometimes overlooked but it can be a key resource in some situations. These can be defined by answering some simple questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>What time is available before the deadline for achieving each action/goal/the overall objective?</li><li>&nbsp;Are these timings compatible?</li><li>Whose time is required?</li><li>Will this time be spent within normal working hours?</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Manpower&nbsp;</strong>may come from within and outside the organisation and can be defined by answering these questions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>How many people will be required?</li><li>What skills, qualities and knowledge will they need to carry out the actions required of them?</li><li>When and where will they be required?</li><li>Will they be available when and where required?</li><li>Will they be available for the length of time required?</li><li>What briefing and training will they need to be able to carry out their tasks effectively?</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Money</strong>&nbsp;can be defined by answering the questions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>How much will be needed?</li><li>Â In what form? (eg cash, cheque, foreign currency)</li><li>How will it be acquired? (eg loan, grant, endowment)</li><li>What will be the source? (eg profits, merchant bank, local or central government)</li><li>How will it be used and is this compatible with the source? (eg if it's a development grant does the plan use it appropriately?)</li><li>When and where will it be required?</li><li>Will it be available when and where required?</li><li>Does it need to be repaid, and when?</li><li>Will it be recouped, how, and when? (eg through increased profits)</li><li>Will there be additional cost in using this money? (eg interest or handling charges)</li><li>Have the costs of all other resources been included?</li></ul>

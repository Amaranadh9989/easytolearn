<p>First, you need to create the conditions-in your body and external environment-to successfully learn and retain information. Here are some study habits worth trying:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Get a good night’s sleep</strong>: A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191001083956.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent study</a>&nbsp;found a positive relationship between students’ grades and how much sleep they’re getting. However, this doesn’t only mean getting a full 8 hours of sleep before a big test. What matters even more is getting enough sleep for several nights before you do the bulk of your studying.</li><li><strong>Switch up your study environment</strong>:&nbsp;This might not seem like a promising study strategy, but studies show that switching up your study environment can&nbsp;increase&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03197465.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recall performance</a>. Instead of studying at home every day, try checking out a new coffee spot each week or heading to your local library. A change in scenery can improve both your memory and concentration levels.</li><li><strong>Stick with an environment that works</strong>: If you&nbsp;you have a good study space at home&nbsp;or a café that is reliably a productive place for you, it makes sense to stick with this when you are under pressure.</li><li><strong>Listen to calming music</strong>: You can listen to any music you like, but many agree that classical, instrumental, and lo-fi beats make good background music for studying and can actually help you pay attention to the task at hand. Songs with lyrics can be distracting.</li><li><strong>Eliminate distractions</strong>: Eliminate&nbsp;distractions by silencing your phone and annoying background noises such as the TV or radio. Make a pact with yourself to avoid checking social media until your study session is over.</li><li><strong>Snack on smart food</strong>: Coffee and candy will give you a temporary boost, but then you’ll have a blood sugar crash. For energy that is more focused and sustainable, try&nbsp;<a href="https://brainmd.com/blog/top-10-healthy-snacks-for-studying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy snacks</a>&nbsp;such as edamame, apples, or nuts.</li></ul>

<h2>4 Study Methods &amp; Tips That Actually Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. The SQ3R Method</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The SQ3R method is a reading comprehension technique that helps students identify important facts and retain information within their textbook. SQ3R (or SQRRR) is an acronym that stands for the five steps of the reading comprehension process. Try these steps for a more efficient and effective study session:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Survey</strong>: Instead of reading the entire book, start by skimming the first chapter and taking notes on any headings, subheadings, images, or other standout features like charts.</li><li><strong>Question</strong>: Formulate questions around the chapter’s content, such as, What is this chapter about? What do I already know about this subject?</li><li><strong>Read</strong>: Begin reading the full chapter and look for answers to the questions you formulated.</li><li><strong>Recite</strong>: After reading a section, summarize in your own words what you just read. Try recalling and identifying major points and answering any questions from the second step.</li><li><strong>Review</strong>: Once you have finished the chapter, it’s important to review the material to fully understand it. Quiz yourself on the questions you created and re-read any portions you need to.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can try this study technique before taking your final exam.</p>

<h3>2. Retrieval Practice</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Retrieval practice is based on the concept of remembering at a later time. Recalling an answer to a question improves learning more than looking for the answer in your textbook. And, remembering and writing down the answer to a flashcard is a lot more effective than thinking you know the answer and flipping the card over early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you practice retrieval, you are more likely to remember the information later on. Below are some ways you can implement the retrieval process into your study routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Utilize practice tests</strong>: Use practice tests or questions to quiz yourself, without looking at your book or notes.</li><li><strong>Make your own questions</strong>: Be your own teacher and create questions you think would be on a test. If you’re in a study group, encourage others to do the same, and trade questions.</li><li><strong>Use flashcards</strong>: Create flashcards, but make sure to practice your retrieval technique. Instead of flipping a card over prematurely, write the answer down and then check.</li></ul>

<h3>3. Spaced Practice</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spaced practice (also known as “distributed practice”) encourages students to study over a longer period of time instead of cramming the night before. When our brains almost forget something, they work harder to recall that information. Spacing out your studying allows your mind to make connections between ideas and build upon the knowledge that can be easily recalled later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To try this technique, review your material in spaced intervals similar to the schedule below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Day 1</strong>: Learn the material in class.</li><li><strong>Day 2</strong>: Revisit and review.</li><li><strong>Day 3</strong>: Revisit and review.</li><li><strong>After one week</strong>: Revisit and review.</li><li><strong>After two weeks</strong>: Revisit and review.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to start planning early. At the beginning of each semester, schedule some time each day just for studying and reviewing the material. Even if your exams are months away, this will help you hold yourself accountable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. The PQ4R Method</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This method takes an active approach to learning that improves memorization and understanding of the topic. Similar to the SQ3R method above, PQ4R is an acronym that stands for the six steps in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Preview</strong>:&nbsp;Preview the information before you start reading to get an idea of the subject. Skim the material and read only the headers, subheadings, and highlighted text.</li><li><strong>Question</strong>: Ask yourself questions related to the topic, such as, What do I expect to learn? What do I already know about this topic?</li><li><strong>Read</strong>: Read the information one section at a time and try to identify answers to your questions.</li><li><strong>Reflect</strong>: Did you answer all of your questions? If not, go back and see if you can find the answer.</li><li><strong>Recite</strong>: In your own words, either speak or write down a summary of the information you just read.</li><li><strong>Review</strong>: Look over the material one more time and answer any questions that have not yet been answered.</li></ul>
